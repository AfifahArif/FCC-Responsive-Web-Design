  <h2> Here are some pivotal moments in her life:</h2>
  
  <div id="tribute-info">
    <ul>
      <li><b>1815 -</b> Ada Lovelace was born to a single mother, Augusta Ada King.</li>
      <li><b>1820 -</b> At 5 years old, she was assigned a private governess and had lessons in arithmetic, grammar, spelling, reading, music, geography, drawing, and French.</li>
      <li><b>1825 -</b> Her lesson plans expanded to also include Italian and further mathematics.</li>
      <li><b>1828 -</b> At the age of 12,  Ada became interested in flying and designed her own wings. She also envisioned using the newest technology, steampower, to accomplish a more high-tech version of flying. This was about 2 decades before a patent for a steam-powered flying machine was issued.</li>
      <li><b>1829 -</b> Became ill and bedridden after a severe case of the measles. This left her temporarily paralyzed in her teenage years although she still tried to keep up with her studies.</li>
      <li><b>1833 -</b> Met Charles Babbage and her soon-to-be husband Lord William King at court.</li>
      <li><b>1834 -</b> Spoke with William Frend, a mathematician and social reformer, on the subject of rainbows. The mathematical theory she proposed was correct even though it was still largely not understood at the time.</li>
      <li><b>1834 -</b> Later that year, she wrote to Dr King who instructed her in arithmetic, algebra and geometry. After recovering from her illness and temporary paralysis, she was eager to continue her education. In seven weeks, she had exhausted everything he could teach her.</li>
      <li><b>1835 -</b> Was married to Lord William King who encouraged her interests.</li>
      <li><b>1836 -</b> Had her first child who she named after her father, Byron.</li>
      <li><b>1837 -</b> Had her second child, Anabella.</li>
      <li><b>1839 -</b> Had her final child child, Ralph.</li>
      <li><b>1840 -</b> At the age of 24 she found a new tutor, a man by the name Augustus De Morgan, as a favor through his wife whom she was friends with. He was the Professor of Mathematics at the University College London and she was his only woman student.</li>
      <li><b>1843 -</b> Expanded on Luigi Menabrea's original French paper which would be the first English account the Analytical Engine. Of the 66 pages, 41 were her additional notes which included the first computer program written down in table format. This method of explaining computation was used for another hundred years.</li>
      <li><b>1852 -</b> Ada Lovelace passed away at the age of 36 shortly after a long struggle with uterine cancer.</li>
